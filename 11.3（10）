Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.
347
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.
46
Given a collection of distinct numbers, return all possible permutations.
581
Given an integer array, you need to find one continuous subarray that if you only sort this subarray in ascending order, then the whole array will be sorted in ascending order, too.

You need to find the shortest such subarray and output its length.

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
56
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
139
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
236
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
